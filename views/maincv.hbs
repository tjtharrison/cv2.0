                                In my spare time, I like to spend my time on bike rides, going to the gym and practicing
                                photography.
                        </p>

                                At the moment I am working on a project combining my skills with docker/kubernetes &
                                server management with learning Javascript to build a Kubernetes hosted online
                                application.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                My time on the computer I spend working on my Kubernetes Cluster, working through my
                                backlog of
                                Udemy courses and working on my Business (Writing articles and managing Social Media).
